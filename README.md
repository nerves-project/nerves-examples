## Setup

Please see the main [Nerves installation
docs](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html) if you haven't used Nerves
before.

You should also be using the following Elixir and Erlang versions:

* Elixir 1.9
* Erlang OTP 22

See the [EmbeddedElixir post on using
ASDF-VM](https://embedded-elixir.com/post/2017-05-23-using-asdf-vm/)

This repository contains several Nerves example projects as sub-directories.
Most of these projects should work on all of the [Nerves supported
targets](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/targets.html).

For detailed information on how to build an example, see the `README.md` in each
application's root directory.
