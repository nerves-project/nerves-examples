# Hello Network

This example shows how to connect your Nerves device to the network using wired
or wireless Ethernet. By default, the configuration assumes that you'll be
connecting using the wired Ethernet interface `eth0`, but you can change the
`:interface` option in `config/config.exs` to choose another interface (such as
`:wlan0` for WiFi or `:usb0` for USB gadget-mode Ethernet). The targets with
built-in WiFi hardware (such as `rpi3` and `rpi0` on a Zero W) will work with
their built in WiFi, but you can also use a variety of popular USB WiFi dongles
on other targets.

## How to Use the Code in this Repository

1. Specify your target with the `MIX_TARGET` environment variable
2. Get dependencies with `mix deps.get`
3. Create firmware with `mix firmware`
4. Burn firmware to an SD card with `mix firmware.burn`
5. Connect a monitor to the HDMI port on the board
6. Insert the SD card into your target board and power it on
7. After about 5 seconds, you should see messages on the console

``` bash
export MIX_TARGET=rpi3
mix deps.get
mix firmware
mix firmware.burn
```

### How to Use the WiFi Interface

Configure the application settings to use your WiFi interface (`:wlan0`) instead
of your wired interface (`:eth0`):

```elixir
# config/config.exs

# ...

#config :hello_network, interface: :eth0
config :hello_network, interface: :wlan0
#config :hello_network, interface: :usb0

key_mgmt = System.get_env("NERVES_NETWORK_KEY_MGMT") || "WPA-PSK"

config :nerves_network, :default,
  wlan0: [
    ssid: System.get_env("NERVES_NETWORK_SSID"),
    psk: System.get_env("NERVES_NETWORK_PSK"),
    key_mgmt: String.to_atom(key_mgmt)
  ],
  eth0: [
    ipv4_address_method: :dhcp
  ]

# ...
```

Specify your WiFi settings using the `NERVES_NETWORK_SSID` and
`NERVES_NETWORK_PSK` environmental variables during the firmware build process:

> Note: `NERVES_NETWORK_SSID` and `NERVES_NETWORK_PSK` are both case-sensitive.

``` bash
export NERVES_NETWORK_SSID=my_accesspoint_name
export NERVES_NETWORK_PSK=secret
export MIX_TARGET=rpi3
mix deps.get
mix firmware
mix firmware.burn
```

### Testing DNS Name Resolution

There is a `HelloNetwork.test_dns` function that you can call in the IEx
console to check that your Nerves device indeed has successfully established
network connectivity and that DNS name resolution works. The expected output
when DNS resolution is available is something like this:

``` elixir
iex(1)> HelloNetwork.test_dns()
{:ok,
 {:hostent, 'nerves-project.org', [], :inet, 4,
  [{192, 30, 252, 154}, {192, 30, 252, 153}]}}
```

### Distribution and the Remote Shell

Whenever the IP address of the device changes, it restarts the Erlang
Distribution node to set its name to `:hello_network@#{ip}` so that you can
remotely connect to it over the network. It will log the node name to the
console, but if you do not have a screen or serial console cable attached, you
can also determine the node name based on the IP address assigned by your DHCP
server. Assuming your development computer's IP address is `10.0.0.100` and your
Nerves device is `10.0.0.200`, you would connect to the remote shell as follows:

```bash
iex --name console@10.0.0.100 --hidden --remsh hello_network@10.0.0.200 --cookie ZKf4a0QT7EHzWCwLey
```
