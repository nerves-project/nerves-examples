# Minimal

This is a minimal Nerves application. It doesn't bring up networking or support
firmware updates. You will get an IEx prompt on the console, though!

It's more useful for seeing what's included in the base Nerves systems. You can
create your own custom systems to reduce the footprint further, but this will be
what we give you out of the box. In some cases, namely for the Raspberry Pi,
it's quite a bit and there's lots of room for reduction.
