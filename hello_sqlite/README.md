# HelloSqlite

This example demonstrates a basic project for using the
[Ecto SQLite Adapter](https://github.com/elixir-sqlite/ecto_sqlite3).

See [scheduler_usage_poller.ex](./lib/hello_sqlite/scheduler_usage_poller.ex) for an example of Sqlite being used.

## Hardware

The example below assumes a Raspberry Pi 0 connected over the USB. Other
official and many unofficial Nerves targets work as well.

## How to use this repository

0. Go to the `hello_sqlite` directory

1. Set up your build environment

   ```shell
   # Specify the target hardware. See the mix.exs for options
   export MIX_TARGET=rpi0

   # To hard-code WiFi credentials in the firmware, you can set
   # the SSID and optionally a password here
   export WIFI_SSID=your_wifi_name
   export WIFI_PASSPHRASE=your_wifi_password
   ```

2. Get dependencies, build firmware, and burn it to an SD card

   ```shell
   mix deps.get
   mix firmware
   mix firmware.burn
   ```

3. Insert the SD card into your target board and power up

4. Wait to finish booting.

5. SSH into the board: `ssh nerves.local`

6. from the IEx prompt

  ```elixir
  # Get 5 entries from the SchedulerUsage table and print them out
  HelloSqlite.print_recent(5)
